# 1 - INTRODUCTION

*FusionCatcher* searchers for **somatic** novel/known **fusion genes**, **translocations** and/or **chimeras** in RNA-seq data (stranded/unstranded  **paired-end/single-end** reads FASTQ files produced by Illumina next-generation sequencing platforms like Illumina Solexa/`HiSeq`/`NextSeq`/`MiSeq`/`MiniSeq`) from _diseased_ samples. Unfortunately we don't have resurce and time to discus this amazyng program. It was the first pogram for somatic fusion with  biological annotation and one of major contribute for the develope of STAR-Fusion.

The aims of *FusionCatcher* are:
  * very good detection rate for finding candidate **somatic fusion genes** (see [somatic mutations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation#Somatic_mutations); using a matched **normal** sample is optional; several databases of known fusion genes found in healthy samples are used as a list of known false positives; biological knowledge is used, like for example gene fusion between a gene and its pseudogene is filtered out),
  * very good RT-PCR validation rate of found candidate somatic fusion genes (this is very important for us),
  * very easy to use (i.e. no _a priori_ knowledge of bioinformatic databases and bioinformatics is needed in order to run *FusionCatcher* BUT Linux/Unix knowledge is needed; it allows a very high level of control for expert users),
  * to be as automatic as possible (i.e. the *FusionCatcher* will choose automatically the best parameters in order to find candidate somatic fusion genes, e.g. finding automatically the adapters, quality trimming of reads, building the exon-exon junctions automatically based on the length of the reads given as input, etc. while giving also full control to expert users) while providing the best possible detection rate for finding somatic fusion genes (with a very low rate of false positives but a very good sensitivity).



## 6.2 - Output data {#output-data}

*FusionCatcher* produces a list of candidate fusion genes using the given input data. It is recommended that this list of candidate of fusion genes is further validated in the wet-lab using for example PCR/FISH experiments.

The output files are:
  * `final-list_candidate_fusion_genes.txt` - final list with the newly found candidates fusion genes (it contains the fusion genes with their junction sequence and points); Starting with version 0.99.3c the coordinates of fusion genes are given here for human genome using **only** assembly **hg38/GRCh38**; See [Table 1](#output-data) for columns' descriptions;
  * `final-list_candidate_fusion_genes.GRCh37.txt` - final list with the newly found candidates fusion genes (it contains the fusion genes with their junction sequence and points); Starting with version 0.99.3d the coordinates of fusion genes are given here for human genome using assembly **hg19/GRCh37**; See [Table 1](#output-data) for columns' descriptions;
  * `summary_candidate_fusions.txt` - contains an executive summary (meant to be read directly by the medical doctors or biologist) of candidate fusion genes found;
  * `final-list_candidate_fusion_genes.caption.md.txt` - explains in detail the labels found in column `Fusion_description` of files `final-list_candidate_fusion_genes.txt` and `final-list_candidate_fusion_genes.GRCh37.txt`;
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BOWTIE.zip` - sequences of short reads supporting the newly found candidate fusion genes found using only and exclusively the Bowtie aligner;
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BLAT.zip` - sequences of short reads supporting the newly found candidate fusion genes found using Bowtie and Blat aligners;
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_STAR.zip` - sequences of short reads supporting the newly found candidate fusion genes found using Bowtie and STAR aligners;
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BOWTIE2.zip` - sequences of short reads supporting the newly found candidate fusion genes found using Bowtie and Bowtie2 aligners;
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BWA.zip` - sequences of short reads supporting the newly found candidate fusion genes found using Bowtie and BWA aligners;`
  * `viruses_bacteria_phages.txt` - (non-zero) reads counts for each virus/bacteria/phage from NCBI database  ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Viruses/ 
  * `info.txt` - information regarding genome version, Ensembl database version, versions of tools used, read counts, etc.;
  * `fusioncatcher.log` -  log of the entire run (e.g. all commands/programs which have been run, command line arguments used, running time for each command, etc.).


FusionCatcher reports:
 * **multiple times** (up to four times) exactly the same candidate fusion gene, which has exactly the same fusion points/junction (i.e. FusionCatcher will output separately the fusions found for each of its four aligners/methods such that it is easy to see what method was used to find a fusion gene)
 * [reciprocal fusion genes](href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23340173) if they are found (e.g. geneA-geneB and also geneB-geneA)
 * every alternative splicing event found for each fusion gene (i.e. alternative fusion isoforms of the same fusion gene)

| **Longest\_anchor\_found** | Longest anchor (hangover) found among the unique reads mapping on the fusion junction |
| **Fusion\_finding\_method** | Aligning method used for mapping the reads and finding the fusion genes. Here are two methods used which are: (i) **BOWTIE** = only Bowtie aligner is used for mapping the reads on the genome and exon-exon fusion junctions, (ii) **BOWTIE+BLAT** = Bowtie aligner is used for mapping reads on the genome and BLAT is used for mapping reads for finding the fusion junction,  (iii) **BOWTIE+STAR** = Bowtie aligner is used for mapping reads on the genome and STAR is used for mapping reads for finding the fusion junction, (iv) **BOWTIE+BOWTIE2** = Bowtie aligner is used for mapping reads on the genome and Bowtie2 is used for mapping reads for finding the fusion junction, and (v) **BOWTIE+BWA** = Bowtie aligner is used for mapping reads on the genome and Bowtie2 is used for mapping reads for finding the fusion junction. |

This is an indication how similar are the DNA/RNA sequences of the genes forming the fusion gene (i.e. what is their homology because highly homologous genes tend to appear show as candidate fusion genes). In case of completely different sequences of the genes involved in forming a fusion gene then here it is expected to have the value zero. |

## 6.3 - Visualization
*FusionCatcher* outputs also the zipped FASTA files containing the reads which support the found candidate fusions genes. The files are:
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BOWTIE.zip`,
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BLAT.zip`,
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_STAR.zip`,
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BOWTIE2.zip`, and
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BWA.zip`.

The reads which support the:
  * junction of the candidate fusion have their name ending with `_supports_fusion_junction`, and
  * candidate fusion (i.e. one reads map on one gene and the paired-read maps on the other fusion gene) have their name ending with `_supports_fusion_pair`.

These supporting reads (given as FASTA and FASTQ files) may be used for further visualization purposes. For example, one may use these supporting reads and align them himself/herself using his/her favourite:
  * aligner (e.g. `Bowtie/Bowtie2/TopHat/STAR/GSNAP/etc.`),
  * version/assembly of genome,
  * mapping format output (e.g. SAM/BAM), and
  * NGS visualizer (e.g. [IGV](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/)/[UCSC Genome Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/)/etc.)

### 6.3.1 - UCSC Genome Browser
For example, the sequences of supporting reads for a given candidate fusion gene may be visualized using [UCSC Genome Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/) by aligning them using the [UCSC Genome Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/)'s  BLAT aligner (i.e. copy and paste the reads here: [BLAT tool of UCSC Genome Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start) --> click the button **Submit** --> navigate into the [UCSC Genome Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/) to the genes that form the fusion genes). Also zooming out several times gives better view here.

### 6.3.2 - PSL format
If one uses the `--visualization-psl` command line option of the *FusionCatcher* then the BLAT alignment of the supporting reads will be done automatically by the *FusionCatcher* and the results are saved in [PSL](http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format2) format files with names that are ending with `_reads.psl` in the:
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BOWTIE.zip`,
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BLAT.zip`,
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_STAR.zip`, and
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BOWTIE2.zip`, and
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BWA.zip`.

The files with names ending in `_reads.psl` may be used further for visualization of the candidate fusion genes using [UCSC Genome Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/), [IGV (Integrative Genome Viewer)](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) or any other viewer/browser which supports the [PSL](http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format2) format.

Note: If one generated the build files using `fusioncatcher-build.py` the command line `--visualization-psl` option should work just fine. If one **downloaded the build files** then the command line option `--visualization-psl` will not work an it needs to be enabled by creating manually first the file `fusioncatcher/data/current/genome.2bit` for FusionCatcher, something like this (here the assumption is that the build files for one's organism of interest are in `fusioncatcher/data/current/`):
```
# re-build the genome index using BLAT where the genome is given FASTA file genome.fa
fusioncatcher/tools/bowtie/bowtie-inspect fusioncatcher/data/current/genome_index/ > fusioncatcher/data/current/genome.fa
fusioncatcher/tools/blat/faToTwoBit fusioncatcher/data/current/genome.fa fusioncatcher/data/current/genome.2bit -noMask
```



### 6.3.3 - SAM format

#### 6.3.3.1 - Automatic method
If one uses the `--visualization-sam` command line option of the *FusionCatcher* then the BOWTIE2 alignment of the supporting reads will be done automatically by the *FusionCatcher* and the results are saved as [SAM](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) files with names that are ending with `_reads.sam` in the:
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BOWTIE.zip`,
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BLAT.zip`,
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_STAR.zip`,
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BOWTIE2.zip`, and
  * `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_BWA.zip`.

The files with names ending in `_reads.sam` (please note, that they still needed to be converted to BAM, coordiante sorted and indexed first) may be used further for visualization of the candidate fusion genes using [UCSC Genome Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/), [IGV (Integrative Genome Viewer)](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) or any other viewer/browser which supports the [SAM](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) format.

#### 6.3.3.2 - Manual method
Here is an rough example of manually aligning the supporting reads (that is named as `supporting_reads.fq` in the below example; the FASTQ files needed here are the files ending in `_reads.fq` from the ZIP archives `supporting-reads_gene-fusions_*.zip` produced by *FusionCatcher*) using different aligners.
  * [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) aligner (where `your_choice_of_genome_bowtie2_index` may be for human, for example [this](ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/data/bowtie2_indexes/hg19.zip))
   * alignment done ignoring the paired-end information (i.e. like single reads):
    ```
bowtie2 \
--local \
-k 10 \
-x your_choice_of_genome_bowtie2_index \
-U supporting_reads.fq \
-S fusion_genes.sam

samtools view -bS fusion_genes.sam | samtools sort - fusion_genes.sorted

samtools index fusion_genes.sorted.bam
    ```
   * alignment done taking into account the paired-end information:
    ```
cat supporting_reads.fq | \
paste - - - - - - - - | \
awk '{print $1"\n"$2"\n"$3"\n"$4 > "r1.fq"; print $5"\n"$6"\n"$7"\n"$8 > "r2.fq"}'

bowtie2 \
--local \
-k 10 \
-x your_choice_of_genome_bowtie2_index \
-1 r1.fq \
-2 r2.fq \
-S fusion_genes.sam

samtools view -bS fusion_genes.sam | samtools sort - fusion_genes.sorted

samtools index fusion_genes.sorted.bam
    ```
  * [STAR](http://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) aligner (where `your_choice_of_genome_star_index` should be built according to the [STAR Manual](http://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/tree/master/doc))
   * alignment done ignoring the paired-end information (i.e. like single reads):
    ```
STAR \
--genomeDir your_choice_of_genome_star_index \
--alignSJoverhangMin 9 \
--chimSegmentMin 17 \
--readFilesIn supporting_reads.fq \
--outFileNamePrefix .

samtools view -bS fusion_genes.sam | samtools sort - fusion_genes.sorted

    ```
   * alignment done taking into account the paired-end information:
    ```

--readFilesIn r1.fq r2.fq\
--outFileNamePrefix .

samtools view -bS Aligned.out.sam | samtools sort - fusion_genes.sorted

samtools index fusion_genes.sorted.bam
    ```

  * [BLAT](http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~kent/src/) aligner (where `your_choice_of_genome_blat_index` should be built according to the [BLAT's examples](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/blatSpec.html))
    ```
# build the genome index using BLAT where the genome is given FASTA file genome.fa

# align the supporting reads given by FusionCatcher (the FASTA 
# file for your fusion of interest can be found in ZIP files 
# generated as output by FusionCatcher, 
# e.g. EML4--ALK__42264951--29223528_reads.fa) using BLAT aligner
blat -stepSize=5 -repMatch=2253 -minScore=0 -minIdentity=0 genome.2bit supporting_reads.fa supporting_reads_mapped.psl 

# visualize the PSL file supporting_reads_mapped.pslin IGV or run psl2sam.pl to convert it into SAM format
psl2sam.pl supporting_reads_mapped.psl > supporting_reads_mapped.sam

    ```

Further, the files `fusion_genes.sorted.bam` and `fusion_genes.sorted.bam.bai` may be used with your favourite NGS visualizer!

### 6.3.4 - Chimera `R/BioConductor` package
For visualization of fusion genes found by *FusionCatcher* one may use also the `R/BioConductor` package [Chimera](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/chimera.html), which supports *FusionCatcher*.

## 6.4 - Examples

### 6.4.1 - Example 1

Here, is an example of how *FusionCatcher* can be used to search for fusion genes in human RNA-seq sample where:
  1. any distance at chromosomal level between the candidate fusion genes is acceptable, **and**
  1. the candidate fusion genes are allowed to be readthroughs (i.e. the genes forming a fusion gene maybe adjacent on the chromosome)
  1. the candidate fusion genes are not allowed to be less the 1000 bp apart on the same strand
  1. use two methods to find the fusion genes (i.e. use BOWTIE, BLAT, STAR, and BOWTIE2 aligners for mapping the reads and this allows to find the fusion genes even in the case that the annotation from Ensembl database is not entirely correct, like for example find a fusion junction even if it is in the middle of a exon or intron)
```
fusioncatcher \
-d /some/human/data/directory/ \
-i /some/input/directory/containing/fastq/files/ \
-o /some/output/directory/
```

### 6.4.2 - Example 2

Here, is an example of how *FusionCatcher* can be used to search for fusion genes in human RNA-seq sample where:
  1. any distance at chromosomal level between the candidate fusion genes is acceptable, **and**
  1. the candidate fusion genes are **not** allowed to be readthroughs (i.e. there is still at least one known gene situated one the same strand in between the genes which form the candidate fusion gene)
  1. the candidate fusion genes are not allowed to be less the 1000 bp apart on the same strand
  1. use only **one** method to find the fusion genes (i.e. use only BOWTIE aligner for mapping the reads and this allows to find the fusion genes only in the case that the annotation from Ensembl database is correct, like for example find a fusion junction only if it matches perfectly the known exon borders)
```
fusioncatcher \
-d /some/human/data/directory/ \
-i /some/input/directory/containing/fastq/files/ \
-o /some/output/directory/ \
--skip-readthroughs \
--skip-blat
```

# 7 - ALIGNERS

## 7.1 - Bowtie

By default, *FusionCatcher* its the Bowtie aligner for finding candidate fusion genes. This approach relies heavily on good is the annotation data for the given organism in the Ensembl database. If, for example, a gene is not annotated well and has several exons which are not annotated in the Ensembl database and if one of these exons is the one involved in the fusion point then this fusion gene will not be found by using only the Bowtie aligner. In order to find also the fusion genes where the the junction point is in the middle of exons or introns, `*FusionCatcher*` is using by default the BLAT, and STAR aligners in addition to Bowtie aligner. The command line options '`--skip-blat`','`--skip-star`', '`--skip-bowtie2`', or '`--skip-bwa`' should be used in order to specify what aligners should not be used. The command line option '`--aligners`' specifies which aligners should be used by default. For example, '`--aligners=blat,star,bowtie2,bwa`' forces *FusionCatcher* too use all aligners for finding fusion genes

## 7.2 - Bowtie and Blat

The use of Bowtie and Blat aligners is the **default** approach of *FusionCatcher* for finding fusion genes.

In order not to use this approach the command line option '`--skip-blat`' should be added (or remove the string `blat` from line `aligners` from file `fusioncatcher/etc/configuration.cfg`), as following:

```
fusioncatcher \
-d /some/human/data/directory/ \ 
-i /some/input/directory/containing/fastq/files/ \
-o /some/output/directory/ \
--skip-blat
```

Please, read the license of Blat aligner before using this approach in order to see if you may use Blat! *FusionCatcher* will use Blat aligner when using this approach!

## 7.3 - Bowtie and STAR

The use of Bowtie and STAR aligners is the **default** approach of *FusionCatcher* for finding fusion genes.

In order not to use this approach the command line option '`--skip-star`' should be added, as following:

```
fusioncatcher \
-d /some/human/data/directory/ \ 
-i /some/input/directory/containing/fastq/files/ \
-o /some/output/directory/ \
--skip-star
```

## 7.4 - Bowtie and Bowtie2

The use of Bowtie and Bowtie2 aligners is **not** the **default** approach of *FusionCatcher* for finding fusion genes.

In order not to use this approach the command line option '`--skip-bowtie2`' should be added, as following:

```
fusioncatcher \
-d /some/human/data/directory/ \ 
-i /some/input/directory/containing/fastq/files/ \
-o /some/output/directory/ \
--skip-bowtie2
```

In order to use this approach the command line option '`--aligners`' should contain the string '`bowtie2`', like for example

```
fusioncatcher \
-d /some/human/data/directory/ \ 
-i /some/input/directory/containing/fastq/files/ \
-o /some/output/directory/ \
--aligners blat,star,bowtie2
```

## 7.5 - Bowtie and BWA

The use of Bowtie and BWA aligners is **not** the **default** approach of *FusionCatcher* for finding fusion genes.

In order not to use this approach the command line option '`--skip-bowtie2`' should be added, as following:

```
fusioncatcher \
-d /some/human/data/directory/ \ 
-i /some/input/directory/containing/fastq/files/ \
-o /some/output/directory/ \
--skip-bowtie2
```

In order to use this approach the command line option '`--aligners`' should contain the string '`bwa`', like for example

```
fusioncatcher \
-d /some/human/data/directory/ \ 
-i /some/input/directory/containing/fastq/files/ \
-o /some/output/directory/ \
--aligners blat,star,bwa
```

# 8 - Command line options

## fusioncatcher
It searchers for fusion genes and/or translocations in RNA-seq data (paired-end reads FASTQ files produced by Illumina next-generation sequencing platforms like Illumina Solexa and Illumina `HiSeq`) in diseased samples. Its command line is:
```
fusioncatcher [options]
```
and the command line options are:
```
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT_FILENAME, --input=INPUT_FILENAME
                        The input file(s) or directory. The files should be in
                        FASTQ or SRA format and may be or not compressed using
                        gzip or zip. A list of files can be specified by given
                        the filenames separated by comma. If a directory is
                        given then it will analyze all the files found with
                        the following extensions: .sra, .fastq, .fastq.zip,
                        .fastq.gz, .fastq.bz2, fastq.xz, .fq, .fq.zip, .fq.gz,
                        .fq.bz2, fz.xz, .txt, .txt.zip, .txt.gz, .txt.bz2 .
  --batch               If this is used then batch mode is used and the input
                        specified using '--input' or '-i' is: (i) a tab-
                        separated text file containing a each line such that
                        there is one sample per line and first column are the
                        FASTQ files' full pathnames/URLs, separated by commas,
                        corresponding to the sample and an optional second
                        column containing the name for the sample, or (ii) a
                        input directory which contains a several
                        subdirectories such that each subdirectory corresponds
                        to only one sample and it contains all the FASTQ files
                        corresponding to that sample. This is useful when
                        several samples needs to be analyzed.
  --single-end          If this is used then it is assumed that all the input
                        reads are single-end reads which must be longer than
                        130 bp. Be default it is assumed that all input reads
                        come from a paired-end reads.
  -I NORMAL_MATCHED_FILENAME, --normal=NORMAL_MATCHED_FILENAME
                        The input file(s) or directory containing the healthy
                        normal-matched data. They should be given in the same
                        format as for '--input'. In case that this option is
                        used then the files/directory given to '--input' is
                        considered to be from the sample of a patient with
                        disease. This is optional.
  -o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, --output=OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
                        The output directory where all the output files
                        containing information about the found candidate
                        fusiongenes are written. Default is 'none'.
  -d DATA_DIRECTORY, --data=DATA_DIRECTORY
                        The data directory where all the annotations files
                        from Ensembl database are placed, e.g. 'data/'. This
                        directory should be built using 'fusioncatcher-build'.
                        If it is not used then it is read from configuration
                        file specified with '--config' from 'data = ...' line.
  -T TMP_DIRECTORY, --tmp=TMP_DIRECTORY
                        The temporary directory where all the outputs files
                        and directories will be written. Default is directory
                        'tmp' in the output directory specified with '--
                        output'.
  -p PROCESSES, --threads=PROCESSES
                        Number or processes/threads to be used for running
                        SORT, Bowtie, BLAT, STAR, BOWTIE2 and other
                        tools/programs. If it is 0 (as it is by default) then
                        the number of processes/threads will be read first
                        from 'fusioncatcher/etc/configuration.cfg' file. If
                        even there it is still set to 0 then 'min(number-of-
                        CPUs-found,16)' processes will be used. Setting number
                        of threads in 'fusioncatcher/etc/configuration.cfg'
                        might be usefull in situations where one server is
                        shared between several users and in order to limit
                        FusionCatcher using all the CPUs/resources.Default is
                        '0'.
  --config=CONFIGURATION_FILENAME
                        Configuration file containing the paths to external
                        tools (e.g. Bowtie, Blat, fastq-dump.) in case that
                        they are not specified in PATH variable! Default is '/
                        apps/fusioncatcher/etc/configuration.cfg,/apps/fusionc
                        atcher/bin/configuration.cfg'.
  -z, --skip-update-check
                        Skips the automatic routine that contacts the
                        FusionCatcher server to check for a more recent
                        version. Default is 'False'.
  -V, --keep-viruses-alignments
                        If it is set then the SAM alignments files of reads
                        mapping on viruses genomes are saved in the output
                        directory for later inspection by the user. Default is
                        'False'.
  -U, --keep-unmapped-reads
                        If it is set then the FASTQ files, containing the
                        unmapped reads (i.e. reads which do not map on genome
                        and transcriptome), are saved in the output directory
                        for later inspection by the user. Default is 'False'.
  --aligners=ALIGNERS   The aligners to be used on Bowtie aligner. By default
                        always BOWTIE aligner is used and it cannot be
                        disabled. The choices are:
                        ['blat','star','bowtie2','bwa']. Any combination of
                        these is accepted if the aligners' names are comma
                        separated. For example, if one wants to used all four
                        aligners then 'blat,star,bowtie2,bwa' should be given.
                        The command line options '--skip-blat', '--skip-star',
                        and '--skip-bowtie2' have priority over this option.
                        If the first element in the list is the configuration
                        file (that is '.cfg' file) of FusionCatcher then the
                        aligners specified in the list of aligners specified
                        in the configuration file will be used (and the rest
                        of aligner specified here will be ignored). In case
                        that the configuration file is not found then the
                        following aligners from the list will be used. Default
                        is
                        '/apps/fusioncatcher/etc/configuration.cfg,blat,star'.
  --skip-blat           If it is set then the pipeline will NOT use the BLAT
                        aligner and all options and methods which make use of
                        BLAT will be disabled. BLAT aligner is used by
                        default. Please, note that BLAT license does not allow
                        BLAT to be used for commercial activities. Fore more
                        information regarding BLAT please see its license:
                        <http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~kent/src/>. Default is
                        'False'.
  --skip-star           If it is set then the pipeline will NOT use the STAR
                        aligner and all options and methods which make use of
                        STAR will be disabled. STAR aligner is used by
                        default. Default is 'False'.
  --sort-buffer-size=SORT_BUFFER_SIZE
                        It specifies the buffer size for command SORT. Default
                        is '80%' if less than 32GB installed RAM else is set 
                        to 26 GB.
  --start=START_STEP    It re-starts executing the workflow/pipeline from the
                        given step number. This can be used when the pipeline
                        has crashed/stopped and one wants to re-run it from
                        from the step where it stopped without re-running from
                        the beginning the entire pipeline. 0 is for restarting
                        automatically and 1 is the first step. Default is '0'.

# 9 - Methods

The main goal of *FusionCatcher* is to find **somatic** (and/or pathogenic) fusion genes in RNA-seq data.

*FusionCatcher* is doing its own quality filtering/trimming of reads. This is needed because most a very important factor for finding fusion genes in RNA-seq experiment is the length of RNA fragments.  **Ideally** the RNA fragment size for finding fusion genes should be over 300 bp.  Most of the RNA-seq experiments are designed for doing differentially expression analyses and not for finding fusion genes and therefore the RNA fragment size many times is less than 300bp and the trimming and quality filtering should be done in such a way that it does not decrease even more the RNA fragment size.

*FusionCatcher* is able to finding fusion genes even in cases where the fusion junction is within known exon or within known intron (for example in the middle of an intron) due to the use of BLAT aligner. The minimum condition for *FusionCatcher* to find a fusion gene is that both genes involved in the fusion are annotated in Ensembl database (even if their gene structure is "wrong").

*FusionCatcher* is spending most of computational analysis on the most promising fusion genes candidate and tries as early as possible to filter out the candidate fusion genes which do not look promising, like for example:
  * candidate fusion gene is composed of a gene and its pseudogene, or
  * candidate fusion gene is composed of a gene and its paralog gene, or
  * candidate fusion gene is composed of a gene and a miRNA gene (but a gene which contains miRNA genes are not skipped), or
  * candidate fusion gene is composed of two genes which have a very sequence similarity (i.e. *FusionCatcher* is computing its homology score), or
  * candidate fusion gene is known to be found in samples from healthy persons (using the 16 organs RNA-seq data from the Illumina BodyMap2), or
  * candidate fusion gene is in one of the known databases of fusion genes found in healthy persons, i.e. ChimerDB2, CACG, and ConjoinG.

*FusionCatcher* is using by default three aligners for mapping the reads. The aligners are Bowtie, BLAT, and STAR. STAR is used here only and only for "splitting" the reads while aligning them.
