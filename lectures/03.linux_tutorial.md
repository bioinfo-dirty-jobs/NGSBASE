##  Introduction


Linux is the best-known and most-used open source operating system. As an operating system, Linux is software that sits underneath all of the other software on a computer, receiving requests from those programs and relaying these requests to the computer’s hardware.

 - GNU/Linux is a free and open-source operating system developed by thousands of contributors and led by Linus Torvalds since the beginning in 1991 Linux shells (commonly Bash)
 -  allow users to execute more than 200 commands and to write pipelines in the Shell Script programming language to automatize tasks
 - Linux is widely used in research and super computers, more than 96% of super computers use Linux:
 - http://www.top500.org/statistics/list It's an essential tool for bioinformatics and big data analysis and research

# How does Linux differ from other operating systems?

In many ways, Linux is similar to other operating systems you may have used before, such as Windows, OS X, or iOS. Like other operating systems, Linux has a graphical interface, and types of software you are accustomed to using on other operating systems, such as word processing applications, have Linux equivalents. In many cases, the software’s creator may have made a Linux version of the same program you use on other systems. If you can use a computer or other electronic device, you can use Linux.

But Linux also is different from other operating systems in many important ways. First, and perhaps most importantly, Linux is open source software. The code used to create Linux is free and available to the public to view, edit, and—for users with the appropriate skills—to contribute to.

Linux is also different in that, although the core pieces of the Linux operating system are generally common, there are many distributions of Linux, which include different software options. This means that Linux is incredibly customizable, because not just applications, such as word processors and web browsers, can be swapped out. Linux users also can choose core components, such as which system displays graphics, and other user-interface components

|ls <directory>| list the content of a directory     |
|cd <directory>| go to the specified directory       |
|cd ~ (or cd)|  go to your home directory            |
cd  ..|go to the parent directory
tree <directory>| list the content of a directory in a tree-like format
mkdir <directory>| create the specified directory 1.2. View the content of a file
less, more| view text with paging
head| Print first lines of a file
tail| print last lines of a file
cat| print the content of a file to the screen
zcat| print the content of a gzip compressed file to the screen 1.3. File manipulations
rm <file>| remove file
cp <file1> <file2>| copy file1 to file2
mv <file1> <file2>|rename file1 to file2 1.4. Some other useful commands
find <folder>/ -type f|recursively find all files in a specific folder
find . -name '<pattern>'|recursively find anything whose name contains <pattern> in the current folder (Single quotes must be used in order to avoid wildcard expansion by the shell)
grep <pattern>|show lines of text containing a given pattern
grep -v <pattern>|show lines of text not containing a given pattern
sort|sort lines of text files
wc|count words, lines and characters
`>` (output redirection)|allow to redirect the output to a file
pipe)|allow to send the output from one program to another
cut|extract selected portion of each line from one or more files
echo| input a line of text and display it on standard output

# 1.5. AWK programming

## AWK - UNIX shell programming language. A fast and stable tool for processing text files.

|awk \'/www/ { print $0 }\' <file>| search for the pattern www in each line of the file|
|awk \'$3=="www"\' <file>         | search for the exact match of www in the third column of the file|
|awk \'length($0) > 80\' <file>   | print every line in the file that is longer than 80 characters|
|awk \'NR % 2 == 0\' <file>       | print even-numbered lines of the file 1.5.1. Some built-in variables|
|NR                             |Number of records |
|NF|Number of fields| 
|FS|Field separator character|
|OFS|Output field separator character|
