## Introduction

RNA-Seq (RNA sequencing ) also called whole transcriptome sequncing  use next-generation sequeincing (NGS)  to reveal the presence and quantity of RNA in a biolgical sample at a given moment.


## Practical 1

In this session we want to perform some differential expressin from two condition as example (Normal vs tumor RNA-seq). This data use for this tutorial are pubblicaly avaible.
Please dwnlad the material here:
   [data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ywFJ9OyKn0Bo9AhxX2nUuKC3Fr4wLdL6)
   
Please follow this  command
   ```
    cd ~/Desktop/
    wget -r -nd -np https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ywFJ9OyKn0Bo9AhxX2nUuKC3Fr4wLdL6
    tar xvf TUTORIAL_RNA_snakemake.tar.gz
    cd TUTORIAL
    conda env create -f snakemake_differential.yml
    
````

Please launch the analisys:

 ```
   snakemake -s ...
 
 
 ```
